# Endatabas

:canned_food: :robot:

Endatabas is a new kind of open source database.

It is an immutable, serverless, dynamic, HTAP, columnar,
SQL-first document store with separated Storage and Compute.

Despite all the buzzwords, it might still be the most boring
(in a nice way) database you use this year.

`endb` will be open-sourced in Q3, 2023.

Your friends, HÃ¥kan and Steven
